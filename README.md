## Introduction

The Diabetes Predictor uses a machine learning model trained on health data to predict whether a person is likely to have diabetes. The model takes various inputs such as glucose levels, blood pressure, insulin levels, and BMI, among others, to make the prediction.

## Features

- **Real-time Prediction**: Enter health data and get an instant prediction.
- **Simple Interface**: User-friendly web interface built with Streamlit.
- **Easy Deployment**: The project can be deployed easily on various platforms, including local machines, cloud services, or any other web hosting platform supporting Python.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Saksham0070/Diabetes-Predictor.git
   cd Diabetes-Predictor
   ```

2. **Set Up the Virtual Environment:**

   Create a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   Install the necessary Python packages using `pip`:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Application:**

   Start the Streamlit application:

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## Usage

1. **Open the Application:**

   Once you run the application, it will be available at `http://localhost:8501` by default. Open this URL in your web browser.

2. **Enter Health Data:**

   Fill in the required health parameters in the web form.

3. **Get Prediction:**

   Click the "Diabetes Test Result" button to see the prediction. The application will display whether the person is likely to have diabetes based on the input data.

## Inputs

The following inputs are required for making a prediction:

- **Number of Pregnancies**: The number of times the person has been pregnant.
- **Glucose Level**: The person's glucose level in mg/dL.
- **Blood Pressure Value**: The person's blood pressure in mm Hg.
- **Skin Thickness Value**: The thickness of the skin fold at the triceps.
- **Insulin Value**: The person's insulin level in IU/mL.
- **BMI Value**: Body Mass Index, a measure of body fat based on height and weight.
- **Diabetes Pedigree Function Value**: A function that scores the likelihood of diabetes based on family history.
- **Age**: The person's age in years.
